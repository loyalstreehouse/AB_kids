bible taking note system for kids
I want to encourage people to use this and add what ever they need to maek it useful.  But request that you contaqct me with any of your additional ideas.  It might be good for others!  Let's help each other.
This was developed first to help my own kids.  Then my sons class.  So Now I take it a next level  and open it up for anyone to use.  Please dont  make money with it. 
This uses html 5 and css3.  The idea is for this to be usable in MAC, windows, Linux, BSD, Android and Ipad OS.  It is also inteneded for it to ebused in a laptop, desktop or tablet.  Working on the idea of use on a phone.  Its editable on one3'smpersonal cloud or offline which is another goal.
If you understand English but know your language does not have such a system talk to me!  I began this first as the Asia Html Bible Note system 21 years ago.  I have tempaltes so that search and replace with a google font supported for the desired language can be used to make a new language version.  The  AHB has 22 languages already.  My target being supporting languages no one would make a bible note system for.  The same is true for the kids version.  The same is true for the school note system.  I care for educating kids and adults.  
Credit belongs to the Lord and the Mom He gave us 59 kids!  Shes 80 as I write this and still learns despite being legally blind!
